# Instagram Unfollower Verifier

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Make sure to READ everything below carefully before using the application.
> - This is a bit more reliable than logging-in on those "**Instagram Follower**" apps you get in the **Appstore/IOS store**. Also avoids you getting hacked as a bonus.
> - Just a heads-up, while using the automated way of opening the unfollowers URLs **Instagram** has some funky rules in place, including temporary rate limits on actions like opening Instagram URLs and searching for them. This usually clears up after a few hours.
> - So I would recommend avoiding the "**Open unfollowers**" functionality from the app and just copying the names manually from the app console and pasting each one inside of your **profile -> following -> (Insert the name in the search bar) -> manually click unfollow.** in order to avoid the rate limit functionality on Instagram.
> - Your anti-virus might block the exe, to avoid this if you have Visual Studio just build the application your self using the provided files in the rep.
> - If you have a better implementation/optimizations to the current solution please send a PR, thanks :)

7. Either use the "**Open unfollowers (all)**" (**_NOT RECOMMENDED BY ME, SPECIALLY FOR BIG LISTS_**) or "**Open unfollowers (custom)**".

## DISCLAIMER:
> [!CAUTION]
> Before delving into the realm of unfollowers/followers with my application, I feel it's crucial to clarify my stance regarding Instagram's terms of service.
While my application is designed to enhance your Instagram experience by providing insightful analytics regarding your followers/unfollowers, it's imperative to acknowledge that Instagram has established stringent guidelines governing user conduct. As such, any actions taken on Instagram, including those facilitated through our application, must adhere to these terms.<br><br>
I wish to emphasize that me, as the developers of this application, cannot assume responsibility for any breaches of Instagram's terms of service, including but not limited to account termination or bans. My role is to provide a tool for analysis, not to dictate or control user behavior.<br><br>
I urge all users to familiarize themselves with Instagram's terms of service and community guidelines to ensure compliance and mitigate any potential risks associated with their Instagram activity.
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
